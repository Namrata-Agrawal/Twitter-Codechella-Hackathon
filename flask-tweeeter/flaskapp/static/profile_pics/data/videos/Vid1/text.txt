Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence they don't seem to make any sense at all where do they come from and what happens if you fall into 1. Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hundred and adams the collapse from enormous gasket under their own gravity in their core nuclear fusion crashes hydrogen atoms into helium releasing a tremendous amount of energy energy in the form of radiation pushes against gravity maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces. As long as there is fusion in the car they star remains stable enough but for stars with way more mass than our own son the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements until they reach iron unlike all the element phil went before the fusion process that creates iron doesn't generating energy iron builds up at the centre of the star until it reaches a critical amount and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken the core collabed it within a fraction of a second the star implode moving at about a quarter of the speed of light feeding even more bass into the call it's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created as the star dies in a supernova explosion this produces either a neutron star or if the star is massively the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole. If you looked at a black hole what you really be seeing is the event horizon anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be travelling faster than the speed of light to escape in other words it's impossible. So we just see your black sphere reflecting nothing but if the event horizon is the black part what is the whole part of the black hole the singularity we're not sure what it is exactly a singularity maybe infinitely dense meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space with no surface all volume up for something completely different right now we just don't know it's like a dividing by zero error by the way black holes do not some things up like a vacuum cleaner if we were to swap the sun for an equally massive black hole nothing much would change for us except that we would freeze to death of course what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole the experience of time is different around black holes from the outside you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon so time passes slower for you at some point you would appear to freezing time slowly turn red and disappear while from your perspective you can watch the rest of the university fast forward seeing into the future right now we don't know what happens next but we think it could be one of two things one you die quick death. The black hole curve space so much that once you cross the event horizon there is only one possible direction you can take this literally inside the event horizon you can only go in one direction it's like being in a really tight and that closes behind you after each step the mass of a black hole is so concentrated at some point even tiny distances of a few centimetres would mean that gravity acts with millions of times more thoughts on different parts of your body your cells get torn apart as your body stretches more and more until you're a hot stream of plasma one atomwide to you dye a very quick bed very soon if you cross the event horizon you would a firewall and be terminated in an instant neither of these options are particularly pleasant. How soon you would die depends on the mass of a black hole. A smaller black hole will kill you before you even entered its event horizon while you probably could travel inside a supermassive black hole for quite a while as a rule of them the further away for the singularity you are the longer you live black holes come in different sizes there are stellar mass black holes with a few times the mass of the sun and the diameter of an asteroid and then there are the supermassive black hole what you found at the heart of every galaxy and have been feeding for billions of years currently the largest supermassive black hole known is s5001 4 + 81 40 billion times the mass of our sun it is 236.7 billion kilometres in diameter which is 47 times the distance from the sun to pluto as powerful as black holes are they will eventually evaporate through a process called hawking radiation. Do you understand how this works we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and animating each other again when this happens right on the edge of a black hole one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the back hole and the other will escape and become a real particle so the black hole is losing energy this happens incredibly slowly at first and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller when it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid it's radiating at room temperature when it has the mass of a mountain about the heat of our sun and in the last second of its life the black hole radiator way with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion. But this process is incredibly slow the biggest black holes we know might take up to a googol years to evaporate this is so long that when the last black hole radiator way nobody will be around to witness it the universe will have become uninhabitable long before then this is not the end of our story there are loads more interesting ideas about black holes with explore them in part 2. A big thanks to freeze account for help with this video. By the way we've made some cookers i've wallpapers in 4k for different screen sizes you can get them on our picture on page which also helps us to make more videos like this december the first month ever with free videos.
