Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence they don't seem to make any sense at all where do they come from and what happens if you fall into 1. Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hundred and adams the collapse from enormous gasket under their own gravity in their core nuclear fusion crashes hydrogen atoms into helium releasing a tremendous amount of energy energy in the form of radiation pushes against gravity maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces. As long as there is fusion in the car they star remains stable enough but for stars with way more mass than our own son the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements until they reach iron unlike all the element phil went before the fusion process that creates iron doesn't generating energy iron builds up at the centre of the star until it reaches a critical amount and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken the core collabed it within a fraction of a second the star implode moving at about a quarter of the speed of light feeding even more bass into the call it's at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created as the star dies in a supernova explosion this produces either a neutron star or if the star is massively the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole.
