This folder contains the methods to convert voice tweets into text, and display the text.

- voice_to_text.py (converts voice to text - and stores the text - whenever a user posts a voice tweet):
1) takes a URL as an input
2) downloads the (voice) file from the URL
3) converts the audio into text
4) creates two files: text.txt contains all the text from the audio; lists.txt enumerates the words and their timestamps in the audio.

- display_text_button.py: displays the voice's text when a user hits the 'text display' button

The folder 'data' stores the data generated by 'voice_to_text.py'. See examples in this folder.
